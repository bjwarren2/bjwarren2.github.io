      <p>As a <strong>Park Ranger Intern</strong> at William B. Umstead State Park, I collaborated closely with park rangers to ensure efficient park operations, including patrol and law enforcement, resource protection and management, and visitor safety. I conducted regular patrols of the park and provided law enforcement services such as traffic control and enforcement of park regulations. Additionally, I conducted investigations related to criminal activity within the park to maintain a safe and secure environment for park visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Resource management</strong>: I gained knowledge and experience in managing park resources, including protecting the environment and maintaining park infrastructure. </p>
<p><strong>Problem-solving</strong>: As a Park Ranger Intern, I faced various challenges and obstacles and developed effective problem-solving skills to overcome them. </p>
