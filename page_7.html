      <p>As a <strong>TSO</strong> at the Department of Homeland Security – RDU, I identified and resolved security threats using advanced security systems and technologies, including explosives detection systems and baggage screening equipment. I provided exceptional customer service to passengers, addressing inquiries and concerns, while ensuring compliance with TSA regulations. I collaborated with various law enforcement and security agencies to maintain the safety and security of the airport and its passengers. I conducted pat-downs and physical inspections, as required, with the utmost professionalism and respect for passengers' privacy. I participated in ongoing training and professional development to remain up to date on TSA policies and procedures, and to adapt to new security threats and technologies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>From this experience, I acquired a variety of valuable skills, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>Security expertise:</strong> My experience as a TSO provided me with extensive knowledge of security protocols and the ability to identify and resolve security threats</p>
        
<p><strong>Customer service:</strong> Providing exceptional customer service to passengers while ensuring compliance with TSA regulations required strong communication skills and the ability to work efficiently under pressure.</p>
        <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working with various law enforcement and security agencies to maintain the safety and security of the airport and its passengers required effective collaboration and teamwork.</p>
        <p><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Conducting pat-downs and physical inspections with the utmost professionalism and respect for passengers' privacy required strong ethics and attention to detail.</p>
